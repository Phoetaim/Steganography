- What size (in bytes) is the input file?
- What size (in bytes) is the output file?
- Based on the size (in bytes) of the input file and your conversion process, what
size (in bytes) should the output file be?

| Language | Input file size  | Output file size | Ratio (x being the size of input file)        |
|----------|------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Python   |        9kB       |       65kB       | 8x because each character is converted into 8 |
| Matlab   |        9kB       |       65kB       | 8x because each character is converted into 8 |
